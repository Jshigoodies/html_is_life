git branch -a (list the branches)
git checkout <branch name> (goes to the branch)

-----
git checkout main
git merge <branch name> (is how to merge barnches)
-----

git checkout -b <branch name> (to make another branch)


if there is some complications. Then when in doubt
do 
"git pull"
"git add"
"git commit -m <commit name>"
git push -u origin main

if you can't commit to your own branch
git pull origin main (probably because the other guy did something to the main branch)
