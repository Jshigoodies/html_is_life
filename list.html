                    <strong>A STORY ABOUT TREATING A FEMALE KNIGHT WHO HAS NEVER BEEN TREATED AS A WOMAN AS A WOMAN </strong>
                    <p class="description">A story about treating a female knight who has never been treated as a woman as a woman</p>
                    <p class="review">Listen, this is revolutionary stuff right here. A WOMAN being treated as a WOMAN? unheard of</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Aho Girl</strong>
                    <p class="description">She is dumb. But she like potassium</p>
                    <p class="review">She's so fking dumb. Like, just bang already 10/10</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alice in Wonder Land</strong>
                    <p class="description">The title says it all</p>
                    <p class="review">I'm going to be honest with you. I think i forgot about this. when i search it up on google, it's like giving me the disney version of it. I don't remember which manga it was anymore.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Amanchu</strong>
                    <p class="description">Most normal anime. Probably like a normal baseline (notice how i didn't say best baseline) for people who want to get into anime and don't like anime but like reality tv shows</p>
                    <p class="review">What even got me into this anime was the round heads that i found as a meme</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Angel heart</strong>

                    <p class="review">I couldn't get past the second episode</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Appetite</strong>
                    <p class="description">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6UKoaGw2nI</p>
                    <p class="review">It was actually a youtube ad. It's gone now. the video is privated or something. Idk why. But it was literally one of the first manhwas or webtoons i read. It's a shame nobody knows about this. It was literally a yotuube advertisement...</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ares (Manga)</strong>
                    <p class="description">Rurouni Kenshin/Inuyasha vibes type of story. That's all you are getting.</p>
                    <p class="review">It reminds me a lot of something like Rurouni Kenshin or Inuyasha. The classic shonens. The stuff way before demon slayer and even further before Bleach. Like, this was the peak of manga. The art style is different than most and It had a good story unlike some stuff now</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Asmodeus</strong>

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Berserk</strong>
                    <p class="description">That thing was too big to be called a sword. Too big, too thick, too heavy, and too rough, it was more like a large hunk of iron.</p>
                    <p class="review">It's still ongoing. I finsihed the whole thing. The anime looked bad.</p>
                </li>

                    <p class="review">I don't really get it entirely. But it felt like the real world problems translated to fights in another dimension.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
